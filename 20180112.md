# LeNet on Caffe (windows OS)

The [instruction](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/mnist/readme.md) probably works on C++. To solve in python, follow the instruction [1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/01-learning-lenet.ipynb) and [2](http://blog.csdn.net/u012762410/article/details/78893830) in Chinese.

1. Prepare necessary MNIST dataset

(windows should use ps1 instead. but it can use wget. Download and put wget.exe under c:\windows\sytem32 may work, but need verifing)

(Differeniate '\\' and '/': [link](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/557013141.html))

(When edit solver, if your path is absolute, edit 'train_net', 'test_net', and 'snapshot_prefix')

!! Complete !!

Preliminary results look good.

# Differences between cd ~ and cd ./

I want to sync local caffe repositary with my online one.
```
git remote add [host (origin)] [url]
git push [host] [new-branch-name]
```
