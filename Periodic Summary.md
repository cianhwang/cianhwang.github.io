# Periodic Summary
## Glad to be back!
After several days working on CVPR rebuttal, I finally get a period of time to rest and prepare for the Ph.D. interview and thesis. Also there have been several days without updating my blog. Now I am back. Before I go back home, I would like to do a little summary and make a list of work I have done in this period and in upcoming a few days.
