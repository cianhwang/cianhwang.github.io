I am a Software Engineer on the Computer Vision and Deep Learning track at NVIDIA. My research focuses on computational imaging, computer vision, and deep learning.

I received my Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University in 2022, advised by Dr. David J. Brady. I received my B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from Nanjing University in 2018.
