# DO WHAT THEY WANT.

1. WHY NO GLOBAL? -- Time and Memory. And better with an experiment.
2. 8 'best' channels? Define a evaluation method and select 8 bands with largest difference. AND compare with PCA
* SSIM would help. 30 bands are fully-connected, so we take one vertex once; until 8 vertices (bands). Need discussion.
3. RGB cases: do 2 experiments: 3 bands and 2 bands.
4. Chen Xi's and Ours comparison, visually.
5. image domain and log domain: do experiments. Draw curve like Zheng's?
6. prepare IID database and own results.
