## My first journey of GitHub
 Today I learned a lot about GitHub, the most popular **'homosexual friend making'** web. 

 Since I grasped the machanism (or flow) of github, I mainly focused on using Git and GitHub desktop app today. I followed the [link](https://services.github.com/on-demand/) and did a lot of trials towards 'push', 'pull' using command line and web (and app). Also, I tried to collaborate with @githubteacher!

 Though something confused, such as 'how to use vi language', 'the relationship between ssh key and github', 'how to pick local repository' and so on... I am confident that I can work that out in several days [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)!

## A sip of TensorFlow
 After being tortured by unsupported VS2017 platform, I finally succeed in installing VS2015 and CUDA. Today I read basic TensorFlow sample program (MNIST recognition). I am on the run to finish my thesis. I hope I could get preliminary results on Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) via learning.

 So the urgent task for me is to understand the codes provided by predecessors first. One day, I would create my own IID network! Good luck!
