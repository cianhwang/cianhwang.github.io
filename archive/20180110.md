## What I did today?
Mainly work on the upcoming interview. Revised Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory.

Since I am totally a nerd to [Torch](http://torch.ch/), I turned to _Direct intrinsics: Learning albedo-shading decomposition by convolutional regression_, and decided to reconstruct the CNN structure in that paper with [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) + Python.

At first I fork the repository from [direct-intrinsics](https://github.com/tnarihi/direct-intrinsics) I worked on the sync with Github in high speed (GFW is so strong). I edited PAC file of SS and use Git bash to clone the repository. 

## Scheduling...

### Interview
Revise Probability Theory.

### Research
1. Understand the grammar of Caffe.
2. Learn how to interact with Python and Caffe.
