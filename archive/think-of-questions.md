## Think of Questions

The most precious part of doing research, should be thinking of questions. The ability to raise an interesting question, and find a suitable or even possible solution is appreciative. Till I began doing MIID project, what's on my mind is that it is really brilliant to come up with this IID thought, and sophisticated mathematical fomulars that could solve it. My advisor told me an his anecdotal story when he was at my age: he travelled around Beijing City to find 3-D animation companys, and managed to persuad his advisor to visit, while other students of his age just requested for assignments. It impressed me a lot. Now I should learn how to think of questions, other than detailed solutions to specfic questions. That requests a bunch of reading and thinking. If I want to form a lab, how should I organize appropriately?
